1. Graph 1 with 3 colors is not satisfiable

2. Graph 1 with 4 colors is satisfiable

3. Graph 1 becomes solvable only with 4 or more colors
   It will be hard to find a solution based on the results of RSat as it does not provide values 
   of variables and only provides running results and whether it is satisfiable. 

4. 8 colors.
