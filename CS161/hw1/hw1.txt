1. For N = 1000, it takes a long time for the program to calculate PAD(1000), and for larger values such as N = 4000,
the interpreter prompts "RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded". This is because large values of N 
requires too much recursive calls to itself so that the interpreter might think that the program is getting into 
infinite recursion, so as it reaches the maximum recursion depth, there will be an execption and the execution will 
be terminated. 

2. PAD(N) = SUMS(N) + 1
Since PAD(N) only returns 1 except for recursions, the result of PAD(N) are recursive added up by 1's. Thus, X 
additions of 1's will produce a sum of X+1. To produce PAD(N) as the sum of 1's, PAD(N) - 1 additions are needed.
